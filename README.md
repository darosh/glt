__Early stage! Work in progress!__

## Demo

_Desktop Chrome should work._

### vue vs ng4 notes

_I am new to both ng2/ng4 and vue._

#### vue
- smaller footprint
- easier to learn
- faster development state preserving hot reload
- route using same component preserves the component, it means less _new \<canvas\>_ created
- UI components: 
  - mostly missing focus highlight
  - vue-mdl might be better choice?
  - cross-browser compatibility
  - future? perhaps [MDC](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/framework-examples/vue)?
- sometimes feels (in a good way) more like AngularJS than Angular 2
  
#### ng4
- switched from ng2/ts, and ng2/js before, js was purely documented
- experimental Angular 4.0.0
- ng4 smaller than ng2, also faster dev reload
- slow app loading, it is so bad, am I doing something wrong?
- bigger download size
- more browser memory used
- UI components backed by Google
